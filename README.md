## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Tailwindcss
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I have just finished a tutorial course for Tailwindcss, so I decided to practice what I learnt with this challenge and it was absolutely fun. It was also a chance for me to practice my React.


### Continued development

- I still need to focus on my layout skills
